	<p>Hi, I'm Niltok, but you can call me Nilly. I'm a <a href="https://linux.org/">GNU/Linux</a> user and I really like the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> and the work of the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, and although I am aware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> is a bit of an a***hole, he's still my role model. In fact, my "blehs" are based on Stallman's "what's bad about" series on <a href="https://stallman.org/">his own personal website</a>, so definitely go check them out as they're very interesting.<br><br>This site is written in raw HTML and CSS because I don't like JavaScript.</p>
