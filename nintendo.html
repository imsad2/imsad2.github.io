	<h1>Nintendo(bleh)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>All of their software and hardware are proprietary. It isn't as bad as, say, proprietary auto-drive systems, but still, bleh.</li>
		<li>They take down mods, fan games and romhacks, bleh.</li>
		<li>Almost all first-party Nintendo games are almost always $40+, and they don't always represent the quality of the game, bleh.</li>
