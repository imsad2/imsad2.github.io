	<h1>Nintendo(bleh)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>All of their software and hardware are proprietary. It isn't as bad as, say, proprietary auto-drive systems, but still, bleh.</li>
		<li>They take down mods, fan games and romhacks, bleh.</li>
		<li>Almost all first-party Nintendo games are almost always $40+, and they don't always represent the quality of the game, bleh.</li>
		<li>They pioneered <a href="region-lock.html">region-lock technology</a>, bleh.</li>
		<li>They have frequently attack ROM sites, which they have the legal right to do, but that's not necessarily the right thing to do. I mean, most of the games distributed on these ROM sites<br>
			aren't even distributed anymore, and the only way to legally purchse them is second-hand, and even then the money doesn't go to the publisher, but to the person who sold the second-hand game. Bleh.</li>
		<li>They also tried to take down various emulators, though unlike their case against ROM sites Nintendo failed. A YouTuber called Nerrel(god bless him) uploaded a <a href="https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=f35i5AVzpsg&ab_channel=Nerrel">video</a>
		explaining this in more detail, so definitely go watch that. Bleh.</li>
